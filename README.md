Background/Problem:

The CRM we use is Hubspot. We have a customer list within Hubspot and each contact has a set
of properties associated with it. Tier refers to the size of the opportunity and thus the size of the
company. Within the lead form we ask users to provide their job title. We use job titles to inform
targeting. This data has never been uniform. We want to understand what titles are most
commonly associated with each tier in the decision making process and what business function
they exist in.
